        <div>
          <p>
            Presentation Invasion, or FRC Team 2135, is based at Presentation High School, a single-sex Catholic school for young women in 
            San Jose, CA. Founded in 2007, our team has grown from a handful of students to 30 active members that participate in the FIRST 
            Robotics Competition. We are an all-girls team dedicated to creating a safe and comfortable environment for our members to learn 
            about STEM-related fields while building robotics skills. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Through designing, manufacturing and programming robots, Team 2135 is actively involved in shaping the female engineers of 
            tomorrow through inspiration and innovation.  Our members are part of both a club and competitive team; each member has a different 
            level of experience and commitment.  We meet all year, though many come during the fall and winter.  Our team has dedicated working 
            space in the Jenvey house garage across the street from our school.  Our machines and tools include a CNC Mill, CNC Table Router, NC 
            Lathe, and sheet metal brake among many other shop features that students learn to operate and use.

        <div>
          <p>
            As an all-girls team, we focus on inspiring young women to pursue fields relating to STEM. By giving them a chance to try real-world 
            engineering through building robots and solving problems as a team, we foster and develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence in these 
            young women. Our goal is to have our members become well-versed in various aspects as they work together to build and design their robot.

            <br><br>
            The 2016 season was intense and exciting and marked Team 2135&rsquo;s 10th season. Co-presidents Liana Rix (class of 2016) and 
            Chris Dhayanand (class of 2016) led the team of roughly thirty students. With their robot named Maximus the Stronghold (Max), 
            the team competed at Central Valley Regional and was chosen for the 2nd seeded alliance by Team 5137 (Iron Kodiaks) and Team 973 
            (GreyBots), playing in the semi-finals. The team also competed at the Silicon Valley Regional, and even after breaking the 
            intake arm twice, they were able to pull all their knowledge and resources together to repair and fix it in time for the 
            following matches. Off-season competitions are still to come.

            <br><br>
            The 2015 season was played with Team 2135&rsquo;s robot named Archie and was led by co-presidents April Mullins (Class of 2015) 
            and Neha Tibrewal (Class of 2015). Competing at the Sacramento Regional, SVR, and at the off-season Chezy Champs Competition, 
            the team worked hard and gained much experience. At the off-season MadTown Throwdown competition, playing the 2014 game Aerial 
            Assist with Atlas and Batlas, the team did very well. Atlas was the 5th seeded alliance captain with Team 973C (GreyBots) and 
            Team 5817 (Uni-Rex). Batlas was chosen for the 6th seeded alliance by Team 3482 (Westmont HS Arrowbotics) and Team 604 
            (Quixilver). Both were quarter-finalists, and Team 2135 won the Gracious Professionalism Award.

            The 2014 season was a remarkable year for Team 2135, and was led by Kiruthika Shanmugam (Class of 2014). After working hard on 
            robot Atlas, the team attended Central Valley Regional. There, Team 2135 was chosen for the 1st seeded alliance by Team 254 
            (Bellarmine Cheesy Poofs) and Team 973 (Atascadero HS GreyBots) and <b>won in the finals</b>. Later at Silicon Valley Regional, 
            the team was chosen by the 4th seeded alliance, Team 1323 (MadTown Robotics) and Team 846 (Lynbrook HS Funky Monkeys), and 
            together they were semi-finalists. Having won at CVR, <b>Team 2135 competed at the FIRST World Championships</b> in St. Louis, 
            Missouri, in the Galileo Division. During off-season, the team competed at Chezy Champs and was chosen by the 2nd seeded alliance 
            (Team 846, Funky Monkeys and Team 971, Mountain View HS Spartan Robotics). They were finalists. At MadTown Throwdown, the 
            team&rsquo;s two robots (Atlas and Batlas) were both Alliance Captains. Atlas was the 4th seeded alliance captain with Team 1323 
            (MadTown Robotics) and Team 971B (Spartan Robotics). Batlas was the 7th seeded alliance captain, with Team 1422 (The Neon Knights) 
            and Team 3970 (Duncan Dynamics). Both played in the quarter-finals, and the team won the Spirit Award.

            their robot Moe and attended the Sacramento Regional, Silicon Valley Regional, and then MadTown Throwdown during the off-season. 
            At the Sacramento Regional, Team 2135 was Rank 6 and Alliance Captain for the 4th seeded Alliance. At SVR, the team worked hard 
            and gained much experience. Later at MadTown, they were on the 6th seeded Alliance.

            The 2010 game had proven to be a challenge. Led by Sarah Watanabe (Class of 2010), the team overcame many obstacles during the 
            building of a more complex robot than previous years. During off-season, Team 2135 competed at the MadTown Throwdown in Madera 
            on November 13. The Presentation Robotics Team qualified as a part of the semi-finalist round and placed 9th out of 20. It was 
            a close game with the team only one win away from becoming finalists. It was a fantastic way to end the 2010 season with an 
            even better start to 2011.

            bright-eyed members. The team made it to CalGames with great enthusiasm, and despite their anxiety and inexperience, was able 
            to place an impressive 12th out of 36 teams. At Silicon Valley Regional, their efforts were shown when they were placed 16th 
            out of 49 competing (and more experienced) teams. In alliance selection, they were chosen to be a part of the 8th seeded alliance.

            expanded exponentially. Their skills were put to the test when the software had to be recoded about five weeks into the build 
            cycle. They were forced to start a new software program with SVR rapidly approaching. Fortunately, the team successfully leapt 
            over this barrier and made it to the competition with their robot performing at optimum levels.

            Presentation High School first became interested in robotics in 2006. Two sophomores, Elaine Higashi and Arielle Jeriza Virrey, 
            had developed a strong interest in robotics and wanted to learn more about the field and its mechanics. After approaching 
            Principal Mary Miller and Dr. Howe of the Mathematics and Science Academy at Presentation, the two girls were given two VEX 
            robot kits. With great enthusiasm, Elaine and Arielle gathered a few other interested friends and began assembling the robots. 
            Within a short period of time, they had completed the project and presented it to Ms. Miller and Dr. Howe. Both were very 
            impressed in the girls&rsquo; voluntary commitment in building the robots that it was agreed a club would be formed. For the 
            rest of 2006, about 12 girls worked on more VEX kits after school for fun.

            In 2007, the robotics club expanded and joined the FIRST Robotics Competition. By this time, the club had transformed into
            a team consisting of 15 students all of which were dedicated to building a robot. Within the first year of entering the
            competition, the students&rsquo; knowledge and skills grew tremendously considering their lack or original knowledge or prior
            experience. The students quickly comprehended the mechanics of robot building and the various fields involved in creating it.

            Naturally, Team 2135 ran into various obstacles along the way, such as a tight budget, safety of the students, and so forth.
            Teachers were concerned about students&rsquo; safety while building the robot, especially since it took place in the school&rsquo;s
            hallways. Presentation&rsquo;s Robotics Team did not yet have a dedicated working area or many power tools, but they were able to 
            overcome the obstacles and still proved successful during the competition. During 2007, Team 2135 competed in the Silicon Valley 
            Regional (SVR) and Sacramento Regional (Davis). In the Silicon Valley Regional, they received the Highest Rookie Seed Team Award 
            and the team&rsquo;s website was given the Website Excellence Award. Once the 2007 season ended, Presentation High School purchased 
            a house as an area specifically dedicated for the Robotics Team.
